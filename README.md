To use this script:

Save it to a file (e.g., scan_directory.py)
Run it from your terminal: python scan_directory.py
Enter the path you want to scan when prompted (or press Enter to scan the current directory)

The script will:

Create a tree-like view of your directory structure
Show file sizes in human-readable format
Skip hidden files (starting with '.')
Save the output to a text file that you can easily share
Use emoji icons to distinguish between files and folders
Sort directories first, then files alphabetically

The output will look something like this:
Directory Structure:
===================
📁 Documents/
  📄 report.pdf (1.2MB)
  📁 Projects/
    📄 script.py (2.3KB)
    📄 data.csv (450KB)
📁 Images/
  📄 photo.jpg (3.1MB)

You can then copy the contents of directory_structure.txt and paste it into a Claude chat to show your folder structure. This will help me better understand the context of your files and provide more accurate assistance.
Would you like me to explain any part of the script in more detail or make any modifications to better suit your needs?
